# tatoeba_cli
boot.dev Personal Project 1: CLI for Tatoeba.org

requires golang to be installed.

to start the cli from bash: go run cli.go

using the example -a command, where -a is a non-white space containing word, the cli will query the Tatoeba.org API and return a list of example sentences. 
The current query from the site can be viewed using the command: query
Additional examples can be viewed using the  command: next 
command: back - will return to previous examples viewed

This idea will likely be expanded upon in my capstone project, which will involve using a database to store a users example sentences and SQL to query information specifically about chinese characters.
